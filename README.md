# Bank marketing
Predicts whether clients of a Portuguese banking institution will subscribe to a bank term deposit when being contacted in a telemarketing campaign. Future telemarketing campaigns of the banking institution could greatly benefit from the predictions made by this model. Without using the model, only 11 % of the clients, that are contacted, would be interested in a term deposit. However, if the telemarketing campaign can only reach 10 % of the clients of the bank, for example, using the model increases the success rate to 52 %.
